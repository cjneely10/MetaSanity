# MetaSanity

## About

**MetaSanity** is a wrapper-script for genome/metagenome evaluation tasks. This script will
run common evaluation and annotation programs and create a `BioMetaDB` project with the integrated results.

This wrapper script was built using the `luigi` Python package. 

MetaSanity provides a unified workflow for genome assessment and functional annotation that combines
all outputs into a single queryable database â€“ all within an easily distributed Docker image.

### [PhyloSanity](PhyloSanity.md)
Evaluate MAGs for completion and contamination using CheckM, and evaluate redundancy using FastANI. Optionally predict phylogeny using GTDB-Tk. A final BioMetaDB project is generated, or updated, with a table that provides a summary of the results.

### [FuncSanity](FuncSanity.md)
Provides functional annotation options through PROKKA, KEGG, InterProScan, the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) database, and the MEROPS database. Optionally, MEROPS matches can be filtered to target predicted outer membrane and extracellular proteins using PSORTb and SignalP. KEGG results are processed through KEGG-Decoder to provide visual heatmaps of metabolic functions and pathways.

### BioMetaDB

BioMetaDB is a specialized relational database management system (RDBMS) project that integrates modularized storage and retrieval of FASTA records with the metadata describing them. This application uses tab-delimited data files to generate table relation schemas via Python3. Based on SQLAlchemy, BioMetaDB allows researchers to efficiently manage data from the command line by providing operations that include

- The ability to store information from any valid tab-delimited data file and to quickly retrieve FASTA records or annotations related to these datasets by using SQL-optimized command-line queries.
- The ability to run all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) from the command line and from python scripts.

Output from both workflows is stored into a BioMetaDB project, providing users a simple interface to comprehensively examine their data. Users can query application results used across the entire genome set for specific information that is relevant to their research, allowing the potential to screen genomes based on returned taxonomy, quality, annotation, putative metabolic function, or any combination thereof.


## Quick Install
See the [wiki page](https://github.com/cjneely10/MetaSanity/wiki/2-Installation) for a complete set of installation instructions.
Download the install script from this repository.

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cjneely10/MetaSanity/master/install.py && chmod +x install.py`

If desired, create and source a python virtual environment.
This script requires `python3` and the `argparse` package. `wget`, `git`, `docker`, and `pip` are also required.


<pre><code>usage: install.py [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [-v VERSION]

Download MetaSanity package

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        Location to which to download MetaSanity package, default MetaSanity
  -v VERSION, --version VERSION
                        Default: docker</code></pre>

### Dependencies

Python dependencies are best maintained within a separate Python virtual environment. `BioMetaDB` and `MetaSanity` must be contained and built within the same python environment. 

### Examples 
Output a list, FASTA contigs, or FASTA proteins for:

- all genomes &gt;90% complete from the Family Pelagibacteraceae
- all genomes that contain extracellular MEROPS-detected peptidases
- all protein sequences of the nifH (K02588) in genomes &ge;70% complete with &lt;10% contamination

Installation can be performed at the user level, limiting the need for contacting
University IT and (except for the memory intensive programs like GTDB-Tk) can be run locally
on many laptops.

## Usage Best Practices

#### Citations

Running a pipeline will output a sample citation file for use in academic writing and research.
Users are highly recommended to cite all items that are output in this file.

#### Config default files

Each genome pipeline has an associated configuration file that is needed to properly call the underlying programs.
Default files are available in the `Sample/Config` directory. To preserve these files for future use, users are recommended
to make edits only to copies of these default settings. Flags and arguments that are typically passed to individual programs can be provided here. See the [usage wiki](https://github.com/cjneely10/MetaSanity/wiki/3-Usage) for more information.

#### Re-running steps in the pipeline

Although the data pipeline is made to run from start to finish, skipping completed steps as they are found, each major step ("pipe") can be rerun if needed. Delete the pipe's output directory and rerun the `MetaSanity.py` script. If a **BioMetaDB** project is provided in the config file or passed as a command-line argument, its contents will also be updated with the new results of this pipeline.

#### Memory usage and time to completion estimates

Some programs in each pipeline can have very high memory requirements (>100GB) or long completion times (depending on 
the system used to run the pipeline). Users are advised to use a program such as `screen` or `nohup` to run this pipeline, 
as well as to redirect stderr to a separate file. **MetaSanity** iteratively annotates each genome, which can result in very long run times (days to weeks) for high numbers of genomes. Future updates include running batch annotations for a user-specified number (*N*) genomes simultaneously, which will result in a time decrease by (roughly) a factor of *N*.

## MetaSanity

`MetaSanity.py` is the calling script for the docker installation. `pipedm.py` is the calling script for the standalone version of **MetaSanity**. 

<pre><code>usage: MetaSanity.py [-h] -d DIRECTORY -c CONFIG_FILE [-a]
                     [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-b BIOMETADB_PROJECT]
                     [-t TYPE_FILE] [-p]
                     program

  -p, --prokka          Use PROKKA gene calls instead of prodigal search</code></pre>

The typical workflow involves creating a configuration file based on the templates in `Sample/Config`. This config
file is then used to call the given pipeline by passing to each program any flags specified by the user. This setup
allows users to customize the calling programs to better fit their needs, as well as provides a useful documentation
step for researchers. See the [usage wiki](https://github.com/cjneely10/MetaSanity/wiki/3-Usage) for more information.
    
### Licensing notes

The use of `signalp` and `RNAmmer` requires accepting an additional academic license agreement upon download. Binaries for these programs are thus not distributed with **MetaSanity**.
