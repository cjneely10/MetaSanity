iss1    PSORTb output
        | Error on line 55 of PSORTb.run in shutil function
        - No such file or directory: /home/appuser/wdir/out/peptidase_results/psortb_results/<OUT_PREFIX>/psortb_out
        | Check for file existence and only delete if needed
        | Runs check for file existence using if statement prior to running shutil.move operation

iss2    Computational speed
        | Very long run time, particularly in PSORTb pipe
        | Begin batching operation
        - Need to commit major refactor
        |* Batching does not result in a significant speed reduction

iss3    Dual docker processes run automatically
        | Launching `MetaSanity.py` results in two docker processes launching
        - `MetaSanity.py` does not appear to have any points that would launch two processes
        | Issue was due to docker processes not exiting properly when pipeline was exited prematurely
        | This is a known docker issue

iss4    Relative paths from cmd line
        | Incorrectly handles "./" and "../" in command-line arguments
        | Used `os.path.relpath()` to remove issue in "./" use
        | Fixes issue, but still requires that files are in working directory.
        - Noted in usage and blog posts

iss5    BioData crashes when small number of genomes
        | According to Ben, BioData fails when genome number, N, <=50
        | Only ran euclidean predictions when N > 50
        - Simple if statement
