iss1    PSORTb output
        |Error on line 55 of PSORTb.run in shutil function
        - No such file or directory: /home/appuser/wdir/out/peptidase_results/psortb_results/<OUT_PREFIX>/psortb_out
        |Check for file existence and only delete if needed
        |Runs check for file existence using if statement prior to running shutil.move operation

iss2    Computational speed
        |Very long run time, particularly in PSORTb pipe
        |Begin batching operation
        - Need to commit major refactor

iss3    Dual docker processes run automatically
        |Launching `MetaSanity.py` results in two docker processes launching
        - `MetaSanity.py` does not appear to have any points that would launch two processes
