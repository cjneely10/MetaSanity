version pipedm:v0.0.3 cjneely10/metasanity:v0.1.0
iss1    PSORTb output
        | Error on line 55 of PSORTb.run in shutil function
        - No such file or directory: /home/appuser/wdir/out/peptidase_results/psortb_results/<OUT_PREFIX>/psortb_out
        | Check for file existence and only delete if needed
        | Runs check for file existence using if statement prior to running shutil.move operation

iss2    Computational speed
        | Very long run time, particularly in PSORTb pipe
        | Begin batching operation
        - Need to commit major refactor
        *| Batching does not result in a significant speed reduction

iss3    Dual docker processes run automatically
        | Launching `MetaSanity.py` results in two docker processes launching
        - `MetaSanity.py` does not appear to have any points that would launch two processes
        | Issue was due to docker processes not exiting properly when pipeline was exited prematurely
        | This is a known docker issue

iss4    Relative paths from cmd line
        | Incorrectly handles "./" and "../" in command-line arguments
        | Used `os.path.relpath()` to remove issue in "./" use
        | Fixes issue, but still requires that files are in working directory.
        - Noted in usage and blog posts

iss5    BioData crashes when small number of genomes
        | According to Ben, BioData fails when genome number, N, <=50
        | Only ran euclidean predictions when N > 50
        - Simple if statement
        | Tested on single genome - no more issues

iss6    Integrate MEROPS and extracellularity
        | Currently, only extracellular hits are stored
        - Request to store all MEROPS hits and notate extracellularity
        | Made 'PSORTb' skip if not set; Collect all merops hits, write boolean value for those with signalp/psortb hits
        | Test using no extracellular lookup, psortb, and signalp - no more issues

iss7    Prevent citations file from being overwritten
        | CitationGenerator only outputs file as "citations.txt"
        | Added date and random number to name of citations file
        | No more issues with overwriting previously generated files

iss8    Overprediction of extracellularity
        | Peptidase determine >90% MEROPS hits to be extracellular
        - Noted as high by Ben
        | Adjusted accordingly - default all None or n/a set as False
        - Issue with pandas parsing - treated 'n/a' as True.
        | Issue resolved, nothing further

iss9	Genomes in project do not update as user-passed directory updates
		| Passing `-d genomes/` adds genomes as needed, but does not remove them from current pipeline run
		- Noted by Ben
		| Adjust project_check_and_creation function and build new Docker image.
		| Deletes directory, if it exists, and creates with new genome set. Nothing further.

iss10	Example run should auto-download with MetaSanity installation
		| Currently, users must manually download example data
		- Noted by Elaina
		| Package test set with MetaSanity github repo and autopull on download
		| `Example-Genomes-Set` folder added to github, autodownload with `install.py` script. Nothing further.

iss11	Interproscan lib not found
		| lib.idn.so.1 Issue - not found
		| Symlink from found directory
		- Rebuild Docker image
        | Issue resolved, nothing further

iss12   CheckM and GTDB-Tk updated to Python3
        | Per end-of-year deprecation of python2.7
        | Dockerfile updated
        | Issue resolved, nothing further

iss13   tbl2asn NCBI update
        | Crashes Prokka on final step
        | Download newest version from NCBI ftp and upload to Docker image
        | Issue resolved, nothing further

iss14   Prokka data not stored if autoremove enabled
        | Folder path deleted before data stored
        | Remove delete calls from pipedm and sequester to MetaSanity.py
        | Issue resolved, nothing further
