BioData
=======

All of my various bioinformatic scripts fit for public consumption (loosely defining "fit")

KEGG-decoder Script
===================
Script used to parse KEGG KOALA outputs and generate a function heat map


Determining Percent Completeness and Duplication for New Genomes
================================================================
This method was used in “Comparative genomics of planktonic Flavobacteriaceae from the Gulf of Maine using metagenomic data” (Tully et al 2014, Microbiome).

Provides the scripts and README to process through new genomes with sequenced related organisms to generate estimates of percent genome completeness and duplication.

Ideal for single amplified genomes and metagenome composite genomes


General Assembly Final Project
==============================
Created as part of the General Assembly Data Science course.

A series of scripts to analyze complete genomes from NCBI for the occurrence of specific elements (N, C, O, S) in the side chains of amino acids.
